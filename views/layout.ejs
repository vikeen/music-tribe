      Stylesheets and Preprocessors
      ==============================

      You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
      using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
      of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
      here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
      are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
      a single file.

      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:

          + Change the order of your CSS files
          + Import stylesheets from other directories
          + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
  -->

  <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400italic,600' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <!--STYLES-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/importer.css">
  <!--STYLES END-->
</head>

<body>
<%- include header.ejs %>
<main class="content">
  <%- body %>
</main>
<%- include footer.ejs %>

<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script>
  (function (i, s, o, g, r, a, m) {
    i['GoogleAnalyticsObject'] = r;
    i[r] = i[r] || function () {
        (i[r].q = i[r].q || []).push(arguments)
      }, i[r].l = 1 * new Date();
    a = s.createElement(o),
      m = s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];
    a.async = 1;
    a.src = g;
    m.parentNode.insertBefore(a, m)
  })(window, document, 'script', '//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js', 'ga');
  ga('create', 'UA-72164322-1', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>

    Client-side Templates
    ========================

    HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
    To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
    that you load these templates client-side.

    By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
    client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
    include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).

    To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Import templates from other directories
        + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
        + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
          stringfile before they're served.

  Client-side Javascript
  ========================

  You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
  on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
  take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

  By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
  automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
  CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
  and concatenated into a single file.

  To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
  For example, here are a few things you could do:

      + Change the order of your scripts
      + Import scripts from other directories
      + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript

<!--SCRIPTS-->
<script src="/js/dependencies/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/js/dependencies/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script src="/js/enable-javascript.js"></script>
<!--SCRIPTS END-->
